# KindHub
This is a student management system.The system manages the student's entry in the kindHub elementery school.

# Scenario 
 
Scenario KindHub Elementry School has been keeping its student entry information in excel file for a long time now. Even though it seemed like a simple solution when it was started. After 3 years now it has become a nightmare to maintain. 
 
Currently, KindHub Elementry has two teachers and 3 classrooms. The Active batch of students are who joined in 2021. Our goal here is to create a student record system (with existing data) which they can use to manage (Create/Read/Update/Delete) studentsâ€™ entry.

# Development Scopes 
Using the students_records.csv design and build a proper relational database structure  
Build a simple RESTful application with Laravel Framework for CRUD operations of students  
Having Authentication would be advantageous but is not a must  
Interactive Frontend UI (ReactJS/VueJS) would be extremely advantageous  
Proper naming conventions is appreciated
